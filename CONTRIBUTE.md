# Contributing to NesjsCLI
We would love for you to contribute to Nest and help make it even better than it is today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow :
 - [Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature)
 - [Submission Guidelines](#submit)
 - [Coding Rules](#rules)
 - [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit)

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem ?
**Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.** You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on Stack Overflow where the questions should be tagged with tag nestjs.

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nestjs) is a much better place to ask questions since:

 - questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else
 - Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to Stack Overflow.

If you would like to chat about the question in real-time, you can reach out via our [gitter](https://gitter.im/nestjs/nest-cli) channel.

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.
